A basic collobrative filtering music recomender built in python using Alternating Least Squares (implicit model)
           - Collobrative filtering are recomendation techniques that use the behavior of many users to predict what one new user might like, without really looking at the content itself
           - So this recomender is not based on any metadata on the artists music stlyes, purely just listening patterns of user -> artist
           - On a basic scale: If user A and B have listened to a lot of user X, and user B also listens to a lot of user Y, recommend Y to A.
Based on 2011 LastFM user listening data (18745 artists included)
Fun project but hoping to build more advanced models in the future!
